# C++ Todo List Project

## Purpose

This project is a simple console-based **Todo List** application made with C++. The purpose was to practice core concepts like file handling, functions, and basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## Features

- **Add Task**: Users can add new tasks with a unique ID.
- **View Tasks**: Displays all saved tasks from a file (`todo.txt`).
- **Search Task**: Allows searching for tasks by their ID.
- **Delete Task**: Deletes a task based on its ID.
- **Update Task**: Edits an existing task's description.

## What I Learned

- **File I/O**: Reading and writing tasks to a file for data persistence.
- **Structs**: Used to manage task details (ID, task description).
- **Modular Functions**: Organized the program into functions for each operation.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implemented task management using basic C++ techniques.

## How to Run

1. Compile the code: `g++ todo.cpp -o todo`
2. Run the program: `./todo`

This project was a practical way to strengthen my understanding of C++ and file handling.
